I am a front-end web developer who's proficient in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and React. As a full stack software engineer graduate from Thinkful, I have over 6 months of hands-on experience in software development. I am looking to put those skills to use now as a developer. I look forward to working as part of a team of developers to create quality products through collaboration. I have experience creating interactive web applications using React, as well as building API's with Express and PostgreSQL.
